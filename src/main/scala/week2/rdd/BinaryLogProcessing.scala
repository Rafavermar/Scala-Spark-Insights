/**
 * The `BinaryLogProcessing` object demonstrates the handling and processing of log data within Apache Spark,
 * emphasizing the conversion of textual log data to and from binary format. This class is designed to showcase
 * how Spark can be used to perform binary data manipulations, which is crucial in scenarios where data is
 * either received or required to be stored in binary formats.
 *
 * Overview:
 * - **Binary Conversion Functions**: Provides functions `toBinary` and `fromBinary` to convert log data
 *   to binary format and back to textual representation. These functions illustrate how to handle common
 *   binary data operations within Spark.
 *
 * - **Log Data Manipulation**: Manipulates a sequence of log entries by converting them to binary format,
 *   distributing this binary data across Spark's distributed computing system, and then transforming them
 *   back into readable text.
 *
 * - **RDD Operations on Binary Data**: Utilizes Spark's RDDs to handle binary data, demonstrating the
 *   flexibility of RDDs in handling non-traditional data formats. This includes parallelizing the binary data,
 *   applying flatMap to decode each entry, and collecting results for output.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * - This class is ideal for dealing with binary log files, such as those generated
 *   by various network equipment or applications that encode their logs in binary format.
 * - It serves as an example for educational purposes, illustrating how to integrate Spark with binary data processing,
 *   which can be adapted for tasks like real-time log analysis and processing in big data pipelines.
